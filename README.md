# Certificates Repository

This repository showcases the certificates I have earned through self-study during my college years. These credentials highlight my commitment to continuous learning and skill development, covering a range of topics from foundational courses to advanced professional certificates.

## Certificates

- **IC3 Digital Literacy**: [IC3 Digital Literacy.pdf](IC3%20Digital%20Literacy.pdf)
  - This professional certification marked the beginning of my formal education in digital literacy. It was a prerequisite for "Application Development" in my second year of university, covering essential topics such as Digital Literacy, Networking, Basic Troubleshooting, and Cybersecurity. This certificate laid the groundwork for my technical skills, particularly in my journey to becoming a data engineer.

- **Understanding Data Engineering (DataCamp)**: [Understanding Data Engineering.pdf](Understanding%20Data%20Engineering.pdf)
  - This foundational course provided a comprehensive introduction to key data engineering concepts, including Big Data, Databases, Data Warehouses, Cloud Computing, and Data Pipelines. It served as a strong starting point in shaping my mindset for the field of data engineering.

- **Introduction to SQL (DataCamp)**: [Introduction to SQL.pdf](Introduction%20to%20SQL.pdf)
  - My first hands-on course in data engineering, sponsored by "Data Engineering Pilipinas," introduced the fundamentals of SQL. The course covered querying tables, creating views, working with data types and schemas, and various SQL dialects. This provided a solid foundation for practical data engineering tasks.

- **Intermediate SQL (DataCamp)**: [Intermediate SQL.pdf](Intermediate%20SQL.pdf)
  - This course built on the basics of SQL, enhancing my practical knowledge of functions such as `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`, and `AVG`. The skills learned here were crucial for working on mini-projects, which are documented in my [Roadmap](https://github.com/christianebacani/Roadmap). The course emphasized my commitment to advancing my problem-solving abilities in data engineering.

- **Joining Data in SQL (DataCamp)**: [Joining Data in SQL.pdf](Joining%20Data%20in%20SQL.pdf)
  - This course deepened my understanding of joining data through Set Theory, Outer Joins, Self Joins, Cross Joins, and Subqueries. I also applied these concepts by building projects that enhanced my proficiency as a data professional. I believe in learning through practice, so I continuously develop projects to consolidate and apply the course material.

- **Relational Databases in SQL (DataCamp)**: [Relational Databases in SQL.pdf](Relational%20Databases%20in%20SQL.pdf)
  - Completing this course was just the beginning, as I immediately applied my knowledge to real-world projects. Key topics covered include Attribute Constraints, Key Constraints, and Referential Integrity. My practical application of these topics can be found in my [Roadmap](https://github.com/christianebacani/Roadmap), where I worked on projects involving data truncation and column migration.

- **Web Scraping (Bootcamp)**: [Web Scraping (Bootcamp).pdf](Web%Scraping%(Bootcamp).pdf)
  - This bootcamp introduced me to foundational concepts in web scraping, such as working with HTML `div` elements, classes, asynchronous programming, and bypassing authentication. One of the most exciting challenges was learning to perform video-to-text transcription using ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) and Diarization with tools like WhisperX and Hugging Face models. The bootcamp was both fun and challenging, and it has motivated me to continue improving my foundational knowledge and practical concepts in web scraping.
