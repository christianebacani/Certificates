# Certificates Repository

This repository contains all my certificates earned through self-study during college. These certificates include completion certificates for courses, paid courses from IC3, and professional certificates, showcasing my dedication to continuous learning and skill development.

## Certificates

- **IC3 Digital Literacy**: [IC3 Digital Literacy.pdf](IC3%20Digital%20Literacy.pdf)
  - This professional certificate was my first paid course from my university and a prerequisite for "Application Development" in my second year. It covers topics like Digital Literacy, Networking, Basic Troubleshooting, Cyber Bullying Solutions, and more. This certificate provided me with a broad knowledge base and digital skills essential for a data engineer.

- **Understanding Data Engineering (DataCamp)**: [Understanding Data Engineering.pdf](Understanding%20Data%20Engineering.pdf)
  - This foundational online course introduced me to theoretical fundamentals of data engineering, including concepts like Big Data, Databases, Data Warehouses, Cloud Computing, Data Pipelines, and more. It helped set the right mindset for my data engineering journey.

- **Introduction to SQL (DataCamp)**: [Introduction to SQL.pdf](Introduction%20to%20SQL.pdf)
  - My first practical online course in data engineering, sponsored by "Data Engineering Pilipinas," covered SQL basics, including querying tables, creating views, data types, schemas, and SQL flavors. It set the groundwork for real-world data engineering tasks.

- **Intermediate SQL (DataCamp)**: [Intermediate SQL.pdf](Intermediate%20SQL.pdf)
  - A continuation of the SQL course that provided more advanced practical skills. This course enabled me to work on various mini-projects (see [Roadmap](https://github.com/christianebacani/Roadmap)) and deepen my understanding of SQL through functions like `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `AVG`, and more. It reinforced my dedication to continuous learning and problem-solving in data engineering.
